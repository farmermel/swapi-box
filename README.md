# Star Wars API Project

### Lego Star Wars

This is an individual project to make a Star Wars facts application. A user is can come to the page and get information about the people, vehicles, and planets of the Star Wars universe. Each card has a lego heart, that when clicked, will add that card to favorites which can be viewed on a seperate page. The page is also translatable to Skyriiwook; the language of the Wookies.
Data comes from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/).
